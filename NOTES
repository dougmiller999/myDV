NEEDED FEATURES LIST (this is always on top)

[ ] derivative 
[ ] integral
[ ] 'span' command
[ ] xmin, xmax?  maybe don't need if integral takes a range.
[ ] take a range of curves for args, e.g. 'color c:i red'
[ ] change font size for labels, title axes numbers
[ ] hide/show legend
[ ] put legend ur, ul, lr, ll
[ ] newcurve: generates new curve from python syntax, e.g. 'nc a.x**2 + 3*a.x'
[ ] L2 norm
[ ] fit command: 'fit a 1 logy xmin xmax'
[ ] give the command line editor and history functions
[ ] menu command takes wildcards
[ ] cur command takes menu output: 'cur(menu foo*)'
[ ] specify position and size of initial plot window
[ ] read .myvrc file for initialization settings
[-] read commands from a file: sort of; a here-doc, 'myv << EOF' works

[03/05/2024] ylabel command works
[03/04/2024] plot screen should stay up all the time, no need for 'p' command

--SUN March 3, 2024

Starting git repo.  Already have the following functions working:
label, q, p (plot), menu, cur, ls, del.  

These don't all quite work right yet, though.  "Menu", for example, does not 
take wildcards, it just lists every curve.  And the 'plot' command is 
necessary to bring the window back each time.  

Added ylabel command tonight.  Added title but it isn't persistent.

--MON March  4, 2024

Wait, the ylabel is not persistent either!  Ok, clearly we need a Plot
class to hold all the stuff and settings we want for the plotted
image.

Experimenting with how to make the plot command non-blocking.
Trying 'plt.ion', for "interactive on".  Ok this works.

    plt.cla()
    plt.ion()
    plt.show()
    
    for c in plotList:
        plt.plot(c.x, c.y, 'o-', color=c.color)

    plt.legend([c.label for c in plotList])
    plt.grid(visible=True)
    plt.draw()

But it makes clear the ylabel and title and color choices are all
transient and the next plot they go away.  We gotta make the Plot
class to hold the state so we can reproduce it when we want.

--TUE March  5, 2024

Made the Plot class, installed it, tested existing functions. Works
great!  Now title, x/y labels are permanent, not disappearing with
each plot command.

Using a "here document" works pretty well for feeding command to myv
from a file.  Not perfect but it'll do for now.

Multiple files.  Hmmm.  Could do multiple File objects, which hold
curves.  Or, just all the curves together, but then how do we do
a.3, b.3, etc?  A fileIndex list that points to the first curve for
each file would do it.
fileIndexList = [ (0, 'file1'), (N, 'file2'), (N+M, 'file1') ]
then a.4, b.4, c.5 becomes curves[4], curves[N+4], curves[N+M+5],
which is pretty easy.  Want to modify ls command to give file info,
too, so we can keep them straight.

Trying to add fileIndex variable but it is broken!

--MON March 11, 2024

Added multi-file support and 'mcur', or 'multiple curve' command which
plots every curve with the same number from all files that have been
read in.

--TUE March 19, 2024

Fixed a bug where reading lots of curves in would cause the color 
index to overflow the length of the predetermined color array.

--FRI January 31, 2025

Added the 'a-zA-Z' labeling for the curves shown on the plot.  It's 
not perfect, it doesn't re-use labels yet, just plows through the
list of identifiers, but the extension to full usability will be easy.

Added mx, my, for modifying data scales.  Added line styles.  Added
'color' command so we can change colors willy nilly.  Added erase
plot command.  This starting to feel like the real thing.

--SAT February  1, 2025

Added big four arithmetic operators, +,-,*,/, as 'add', 'sub', 'mul',
and 'div' commands.

--SUN February  2, 2025

Adding functions of curves; 'log', 'log10', 'exp', 'sin',
'cos'. Honestly, not going to bother adding more until it comes up.
It's super easy to add a fuction, especially if it's already in numpy,
and seriously, I am not going to do anything so weird it isn't already
in numpy.  Probably.

The more I screw with this the more the memories come back and I add
another feature to the list.  Added 'hide/show'.  Should add 'ran' and
'dom', but I'll have to learn about matplotlib axes some more, again.
:-) Ok, I added 'ran' and 'dom', just had to have them!  Works pretty
well, too.
